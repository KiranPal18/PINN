# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This repository contains introductory and applied implementations of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**.  
The purpose of this work is to understand how neural networks can be used to solve differential equations by embedding physical laws into the learning process.  
These implementations are created **purely for learning and experimentation**.

## Project Overview

PINNs are a class of neural networks that combine data-driven learning with known physical equations, such as PDEs or ODEs.  
They minimize both data loss and physics-based residual loss, allowing the model to satisfy governing equations while fitting observed data.

This repository includes two main implementations:

1. **`PINN.ipynb`**  
   - Basic implementation of a PINN for conceptual understanding.  
   - Trained on a **dummy dataset** to demonstrate how physics constraints are incorporated into loss functions.  
   - Covers network architecture, physics-based loss, and training visualization.

2. **`PINN_on_Burger_equation.ipynb`**  
   - Full PINN model trained on the **[PDE Dataset (Burgersâ€™ Equation)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scaomath/pde-dataset?select=burgers_v1000_smooth_1024.mat)**.  
   - Demonstrates solving partial differential equations using physics-based supervision.  
   - Implements data preprocessing, network setup, and loss minimization using both data and PDE residuals.  
   - Focused on practical understanding of training PINNs on real physical systems.
